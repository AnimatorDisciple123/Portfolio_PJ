                <p>I was raised by a hard-working mother and with an intelligent brother.
                    It's a miracle that I have transformed my life in such amazing ways.
                    I mean, come on, I'm a coder, guitarist, and mathematician and go to a public school!
                    Isn't that amazing? 
                </p> 
                
                <p>

                    I came to the USA at a very young age ( since kindergarten) and have been living here ever since.
                    As young juvenile in a foreign land, I was bullied and teased for my accent and my oh so odoriferous lunch.
                    But I didn't let that stop me. I kept on exploring and learning and growing, making true friedns along the way!
                    Now I am the center of a friend group and have high reputation in my school!
                </p>

                <p>
                    After some time, I got used to the American culture and started to embrace it.
                    I maintained my Indian roots, but also started to self-encourage sociality and friendliness with other unique 
                    people.
